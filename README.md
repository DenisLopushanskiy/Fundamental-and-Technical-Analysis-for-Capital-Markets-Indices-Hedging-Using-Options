My master thesis on emerging and developed markets

The execution file is "Main.py", but be careful with training part.

Commented part with training takes too much time though it is as optimized as could made it (takes about 30 hours). For faster training use train_set_multiprocess.py (works with only if number of cores is more than one). Still takes a long time (9 hours totally). Other code works much faster. 
Plots are commented, but the script is valid.
